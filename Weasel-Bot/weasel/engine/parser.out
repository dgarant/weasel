Rule 0     S' -> start
Rule 1     start -> put
Rule 2     start -> exec
Rule 3     start -> ping
Rule 4     put -> PUT STRING FILESTR
Rule 5     exec -> EXEC STRING
Rule 6     ping -> PING
Rule 7     createuser -> CREATEUSER STRING STRING

Terminals, with rules where they appear

CREATEUSER           : 7
EXEC                 : 5
FILESTR              : 4
PING                 : 6
PUT                  : 4
STRING               : 4 5 7 7
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

createuser           : 
exec                 : 2
ping                 : 3
put                  : 1
start                : 0
